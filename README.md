# Spell-Checker

In this project I implemented a hash table with three hashing techniques of short strings.

First hash function - returns the hash value of the first letter in the word.

Second hash function - returns the sum of all the letters in the word.

Third hash function (best) - returns a calculation according to a formula that goes through each letter in the word.

The system reads a text file with 3000 words in the English language and enters them into the hash table 
according to the hash function that was chosen by the user.

With the help of the hash table, the system performs spelling checks for all the words in 
the string that the user entered and offers several possibilities of corrections as needed.

# For example for the sentence: 
"iam afraid youare about to become teh immexdiate pst president of teh eing alive club ha ha glados"

# We will receive after the spelling check:
